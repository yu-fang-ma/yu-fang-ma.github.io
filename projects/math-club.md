While living in Taiwan, I participated in my school’s math club. The math club met every week, and each time a teacher led us to learn math in a fun and interesting way.

Each time we met, all the people were separated into groups of three people. There is no group leader, all the people are members. The teacher will introduce the topic first, then give us material to do the activities. All the members will participate in the group discussion, and try to finish the task.

At first, I felt very stressed about the activities because I could feel that my team members’ math levels were all better than mine. However, after many times of meetings, and getting to know my members more, I was able to be more comfortable during the meetings. I won’t be afraid to ask for help when I need it and can join the group discussion as much as I can.
