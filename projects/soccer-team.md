summary: "The experience of joining the school soccer team in Taiwan."
---

When I was living in Taiwan, my classmates and I represented our school to played the Taipei soccer competition. We won the second place, and I have scored a goal.

Before the competition started, my classmates and I practiced playing soccer every day during lunchtime. We are a team and one thing that our coach often reminds us is that do not play a solo game. Our coach wants us to practice teamwork, and communicate with our teammates. 

Because of the practice, I got to understand my classmates better. Iâ€™m able to know which classmates play better and which ones do not, I got to know where to stand to help my classmates and will pass the ball when needed. To me, this is a valuable memory because this is the first time that I truly understand the importance of teamwork and communication, those skills are not only applied in athletics but also to the future of life.
