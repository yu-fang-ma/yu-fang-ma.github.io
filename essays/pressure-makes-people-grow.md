Athletic software engineering is a pedagogy that helps students improve their coding skills, and doing WOD is one of the activities that force students to solve coding problems in a limited time. I’m a student who has experience participating in the activity, and I think it is useful to help students find out their coding ability, and be able to make improvements.

From my perspective and experience, since WOD has a time limit, students will be trained to think in a very fast way. Students need to understand the problem and come up with a possible solving method in a very short time. After that, students need to finish writing the code and test it to figure out whether the method they come up with can solve the problem. To finish writing the code in a very short time, students also need to be very familiar with the programming language they are using. This process helps students figure out whether they are familiar with the programming language they’re using, and also able to know which part of the programming language they are unfamiliar with.

When I participated in the WODs activities, the programming language that I use is Javascript. I never learned how to write code in Javascript before, so at first I thought it was a challenge for me. However, after learning the fundamental concept of Javascript, I would say that if you have learned a programming language before, you should be okay with it. To me, although some of the concepts for Javascript are different than the other languages, the general idea of how Javascript works is the same as the other languages.

Is Javascript a good or bad programming language? I think it depends. There are some features in Javascript that I have never seen in other programming languages before that help make things easier. On the other hand, some features in Javascript will easily cause bugs or errors. To avoid errors or bugs and be able to write good code, people should keep practicing, and I would say that doing the WOD is one of the best ways to help people achieve this goal.

Overall, although the whole process of doing the WODs may be stressful for people, the purpose of it is to let students challenge themselves and inspire potential. I believe when students overcome the challenges, it will be an enjoyable and worthwhile process.
