## What is Software Engineering?

According to Michigan Tech, Software Engineering is related to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. The work that Software engineers can do involves designing and developing operating systems, business applications, computer games, and network control systems. Because of the variety of work, the careers that Software engineers can be involved in are also very wide. From automobiles to telecommunications and security, all of these careers can be related to Software Engineering.

## Explore your interests

I do not have any software engineering experience before, therefore, I think it is good for me or any person who is the same as me to try any aspect of software engineering to explore their interests. Understanding and experiencing more aspects of computer science or software engineering can help a person understand what kind of job is more interesting to them or be able to find out what type are job they are good at. For me, when I look at what Software Engineering is about, I’m interested in the part that is related to business applications and data management. I hope I can develop more skills and experience related to these two topics and be able to use them in my future career. 

## Learning isn’t a bad thing

Moreover, while the person is exploring their interests, they can gain something variable. The skills and experience the person got during their exploration can be useful in their future career life, and people should all know that learning isn’t a bad thing.
