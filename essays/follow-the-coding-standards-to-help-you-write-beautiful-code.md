## What is “Coding Standards” and why it is important?

Coding Standards are guidelines and rules that help people write more efficient, cleaner, readable, high-quality, consistent, and minimal error code. It is a technique that can help you understand other people’s code, but also other people understand your code. But why should we understand other people’s code, and let others understand our code? After you graduate and get a job in a tech company, it is often that you need to finish a project or something. Since the project is too large for a person to complete by themselves, teamwork is an important thing that every person should learn. To interact with other people smoothly and successfully, understanding what other people are doing is a key point to focus on, and writing codes that follow the Coding Standards is the path to help you achieve the goal. Moreover, writing the code following the Coding Standards can reduce mistakes and errors people make when writing their code since the Coding Standards can help people know what they are thinking, doing, and writing.

## Is following the Coding Standards a difficult thing?

In my opinion, I don’t think following the Coding Standards is a difficult thing. I think it is just like you need to write homework in a specific format. When you are a student or now you are a student, some Professors or teachers will require students to write their homework in a format. For example, where to put your name and date, what font size should you use, and what font type to use. Coding Standards are just like this, but the rules apply to the code. For example, how many spaces to indent and if you need to add a new line or not.

## ESLint and the green checkmark

Recently, I started using ESLint for IntelliJ. At first, because I was not familiar with ESLint, I had a lot of warming for my code that needed to be solved. However, after understanding what kind of style ESLint wants me to put my code in, the number of warmings I got decreased a lot. It is easier for me to get a green checkmark, and every time I get a green checkmark, I feel joyful. I think it is a happy thing to see that your code does not include any red marks and has a green checkmark!
